CS50 Final Project - Public Facebook Data Analysis

This is a cs_50 final project.

The goal is pretty simple - to analyze and compare public activities (posts, likes, reactions, ...) on Facebook's pages of three banks located in the Czech republic using open source tools (R, MySQL, Metabase).

All the code is available in the specific folders.

Sensitive data (nfacebook users names) are anonymized using hash functions.
